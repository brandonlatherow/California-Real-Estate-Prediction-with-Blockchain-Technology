# **Real Estate Prediction with Blockchain Technology**

<br />

### **Machine Learning**

<br />

In this project, we will be using Kaggle to pull data on California home prices. The home pricing will then be evaluated with multiple Machine Learning models to predict future buying opportunities. The machine learning models that we will compare include: 


* ***Linear Regression***


* ***K Nearest Neighbors*** 


* ***Random Forest***

* ***Gradient Boosting Regressor***


* ***Neural Networks***

### **Blockchain**

<br />

Via Blockchain Technology and using Streamlit, we will use the Machine Learning predictions to give investors buying opportunities, using Ethereum.
